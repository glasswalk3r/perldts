ENABLING EXTENDED TESTS

Extended tests that will connect to a MS SQL Server database to fetch DTS package
information and therefore tests the methods.

Enabling extended test is a good idea: in fact, executing only the simple tests
will not test much thing and mocking DTS objects is not a simple task. If you're going
to extended or modify the DTS API, is a very good idea to enable extended tests.

To enable the extended tests is necessary to:

1 - Save the DTS package sample ("test-all.dts") that comes with the module tarball in the database.
2 - Edit the XML file "test-config.xml". If your server uses trusted method to authenticate 
then the only thing that needs to be edit is the servername. Otherwise, add the 
<user>user</user> and <password>password</password> inside the "credential" tag. Of course, 
do not forget to use valid user and password information. The "test_conf.dtd" should help you a bit if 
you are able to use a XML validator.
