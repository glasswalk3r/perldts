DTS_UT version 0.01
===================

DTS_UT is a web application provided as example of using of PerlDTS project.

This set of Perl modules and files are a complete MVC based web application that enables unit test to be
executed against MS SQL Server DTS packages.

The application will use a single YAML configuration file with details to connect to a MS SQL Server. Then
it will be able to list all DTS packages available and the user can select one or more packages to execute a
already defined test.

Check the POD documentation after installing for more information.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

If you're using ActivePerl 5.8.x or 5.10.x, then it will be easier if you download a PPM package from the project
website. After unziping the file, execute:

   ppm install DTS.ppd

This application was tested against IIS 5 and Apache 2.2.

SETUP FOR IIS

Step 1: create an environment variable (system variable) with the name CGIAPP_CONFIG_FILE. This variable will be used by 
the application to know the location of the YAML configuration file, so the value of this variable must be the location
of this file.

Step 2: after the PPM package (or the tarball) of PerlDTS was installed, the configuration file will be located at 
<Perl location>site\lib\DTS_UT\config, where <Perl location> is the directory where Perl was installed. Copy the file
config.yml to the location you had setup for CGIAPP_CONFIG_FILE in step 1.

Step 3: edit the config.yml file as necessary. The default values should work.

Step 4: copy the files checkAll.js and test_result.css (in site\lib\DTS_UT\View) to the webroot directory in IIS 
web server.

Step 5: copy the file dts.pl to the Scripts directory of IIS. If you installed ActivePerl correctly, all mappings
to execute the script will be already done.

Step 6: edit the file ut_config.yml. This file has the credentials to log in the MS SQL Server where the DTS packages
are located. This configuration file expected that you're using a trusted connection,  if not you will need to change
the modules DTS_UT::Model::UnitTestExec.pm and DTS_UT::Model::DTS too.

Step 7: add the IIS user as a MS SQL Server user, or you will not be able to authenticate to the database server.

Step 8: finally, connect to http://localhost/scripts/dts.pl or whatever host name you use to access the IIS.

SETUP FOR APACHE

Almost the same for IIS, except that you will need to edit the httpd.conf file (check the last line of httpd.conf
provided as a sample in the config directory of PerlDTS distribution) and the dts.cgi file must be copied to the
directory cgi-bin.

To test, just point to http://localhost/cgi-bin/dts.cgi.
