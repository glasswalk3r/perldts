=head1 NAME

DTS_UT - Perl distribution of modules to implement DTS packages unit testing in a MVC web application

=head1 SYNOPSIS

# no code to see here. This is only a POD!

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is only documentation for a series of modules and templates for a implementation of unit tests for MS SQL 
Server 2000 DTS packages.

C<DTS_UT> package is a set of Perl modules that implement a simple web application to execute tests on DTS packages and
return the results in a (hopefully) nice interface.

Tests are implemented using the L<DTS> and L<Test::More> (including related modules). In theory, anything that can 
return an output as expected by L<Test::Harness::Strap> can be used to. Tests can be executed concurrently too, but this
will depend also on what the test will do.

The web application was built with L<CGI::Application> and L<HTML::Template> modules and is expected to be executed from
a webserver that supports standard CGI, like Apache and IIS. It will not work on operational systems that do not 
support MS Windows OLE.

=head2 EXPORT
