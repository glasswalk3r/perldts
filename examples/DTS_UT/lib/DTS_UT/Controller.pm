=head1 NAME

DTS_UT::Controller - Controller superclass for DTS Unit Testing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use DTS_UT::Controller;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<DTS_UT::Controller> is a MVC Controller superclass. It should be used by subclasses to have easier configuration by an
YAML file.

C<DTS_UT::Controller> will use an YAML file for configuration. The complete pathname of the YAML should be available in
the environment variable C<CGIAPP_CONFIG_FILE>. For Apache server, this must be done with a C<SetEnv> directive. For IIS, 
declaring a global environment variable will do it, just remember to restart IIS after doing that.

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.
