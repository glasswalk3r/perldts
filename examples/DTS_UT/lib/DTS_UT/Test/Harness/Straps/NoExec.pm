=head1 NAME

DTS_UT::Test::Harness::Straps::NoExec - subclass of C<Test::Harness::Straps> to eval test file code instead of forking 
a process to execute it.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<DTS_UT::Test::Harness::Straps::NoExec> will execute a test file code (Perl code, of course) by using an C<eval> instead
of forking a process to execute the script and read the results from it.

This is usefull to execute test in a web application running in a Apache/mod_perl or IIS/PerlEz environment, were 
forking a new process from the server process itself is never a good idea for performance reasons. There are some issues
forking with IIS 5 with Perl, so this modules solves this problem as well.

C<DTS_UT::Test::Harness::Straps::NoExec> is a hack from C<Test::Harness::Straps> module. Those modules are not maintained
anyore, so if you're taking serious about using it, my recomendation is that you check out L<TAP::Parser> module 
documentation.

=head1 EXPORT

=head1 METHODS

=head2 analyze_file

Overrides C<analyze_file> method from C<Test::Harness::Straps> class.

Expects two parameters (in this order): the package name that will be tested and 
the file that will hold the results from the Perl code C<eval>ued. The test script than needs to change it's output to
a text file instead of C<STDOUT> and C<STDERR>.

See the methods C<failure_output> and C<output> of L<Test::More::Builder> class.
