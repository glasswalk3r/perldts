=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Win32::SqlServer::DTS::Assignment::Query> is a subclass of L<Win32::SqlServer::DTS::Assignment|Win32::SqlServer::DTS::Assignment> superclass. It represents
a DTS C<DynamicPropertiesTaskAssignment> object that has the properties C<SourceQueryConnectionID> 
and C<SourceQuerySQL> defined.

Unless you want to extend the C<DTS> API is quite probably that you're going to use C<Win32::SqlServer::DTS::Assignment::Query> 
returned by the C<get_properties> method from C<Win32::SqlServer::DTS::Task::DynamicProperty> class.

=head2 EXPORT

Nothing.

=head2 METHODS

Inherits all methods from C<Win32::SqlServer::DTS::Assignment>.

=head3 new

Extends superclass method C<new> by modifying the C<source> attribute.

=head3 get_source

Overrided method from L<Win32::SqlServer::DTS::Assignment|Win32::SqlServer::DTS::Assignment> class. It will returns a result depending on the context
the method was invoked. in a scalar context, it will return a string with the results of the methods C<get_connection_id>
 and C<get_query_sql> respectivally, separated by points and quoted with square brackets. In a list context, it
will return a list with the values of the methods C<get_connection_id> and C<get_query_sql>, in this order.

See L<Win32::SqlServer::DTS::Assignment|Win32::SqlServer::DTS::Assigment/get_destination> method for more information about how a property is setup using
a Dynamic Properties Task Assignment.

__END__

=head3 get_connection_id

Returns a string with the ConnectionID property of a DTS Connection object.

=head3 get_query_sql

Returns a string with the SQL query defined. The string will be returned exactly how it was created, so don't blame
the API with the SQL is in a bad format.
