package Win32::SqlServer::DTS::AssignmentTypes;

=head1 NAME

Win32::SqlServer::DTS::AssigmentTypes - a Perl abstract class that knows all DynamicPropertiesTaskAssignment objects types.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Win32::SqlServer::DTS::AssignmentTypes;

	# assuming that $assignment is a DTS Dynamic Property assignment object
	my $type = Win32::SqlServer::DTS::AssignmentTypes->get_class_name($assignment->SourceType);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Win32::SqlServer::DTS::AssignmentTypes> is a simple abstract class that knows all existing types of DTS Dynamic Properties assignments
types and how to convert those types to Win32::SqlServer::DTS::Assignment subclasses names. 

This abstract class should be used only if one wants to extend the C<DTS> API.

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.

=head2 METHODS

=head3 get_class_name

C<get_class_name> is an B<abstract method> that converts the numeric type code from DTS API constant 
C<DynamicPropertiesTaskSourceType> to a proper string that represents a subclass of C<Win32::SqlServer::DTS::Assignment> class.
Returns one of the following strings, depending on the numeric code received as a parameter:

=item *
INI

=item *
Query

=item *
GlobalVar

=item *
EnvVar

=item *
Constant

=item *
DataFile

The valid types are:

 Symbol                                             Value  Description
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 DTSDynamicPropertiesSourceType_Constant              4    Source is a constant.
 DTSDynamicPropertiesSourceType_DataFile              5    Source is the contents of a data file.
 DTSDynamicPropertiesSourceType_EnvironmentVariable   3    Source is the value of a system environment variable.
 DTSDynamicPropertiesSourceType_GlobalVariable        2    Source is the value of a DTS global variable within
                                                           the package.
 DTSDynamicPropertiesSourceType_IniFile               0    Source is the value of a key within an .ini file.
 DTSDynamicPropertiesSourceType_Query                 1    Source is a value returned by an SQL query.
